# Contributing to the TwinCAT_UnitTestLibrary

All contributions are welcome:
* Code changes should be submitted via a pull request.
* Please follow the coding style of the existing code:
    1. Use spaces not tabs. This can be configured in Visual Studio under **Tools→Options→TwinCAT→Plc Environment→Text Editor** by unchecking the 'Keep Tabs' checkbox. Tab width should be set to '4'
    2. Do not prefix variable names according to their data type.
    3. Use Separate LineIDs to minimise changes to POUs. This can be configured in Visula Studio under **Tools→Options→TwinCAT→Write Options→Separate LineIDs.**
    
* Please report bugs using GitHub Issues
